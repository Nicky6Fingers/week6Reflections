I just want to say again how helpful i think it is about all of these extensions that we use to help us format our code and more easily identify the problems. I feel like this si something should have used years ago, but i think some people think that the amount of helps it gives is too much and stunts learning? but i think these tools simply help you become more efficent.

Gitignore- this is inportant in terms of it makes it so the repo is cluttered  up with stuff we don't need there.
package.json- lets you know the things that you are using for the project that is open.

**function** - functions "DO" (addPayroll) notice the camelCase like C# most functions we use will have return value used by doing the __return__ keyword
**Paramaters** - parameters are the items __wrong term probably__ that are used in the function (num1 +num2). make the items clear and not single characters.
**Call a function** - Call by name, put in the argumnet and the paramaters which kinda act like placeholders. and store the number in a variable.
**Variables**- hold values/data, important to use sensible names and use camelCase!
**Display** - use the console.log to display the results.
**Const** - this is the constant keyword a good example for this is something that isnt usualy changed like a tax rate.
